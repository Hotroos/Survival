Stress is a universal human experience, marked by physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual reactions to life’s pressures. It presents challenges, helps us understand our values and strengths, and tests our adaptability and flexibility. Stress can be both constructive and destructive, depending on how we perceive and respond to it.

Stressors, the events that trigger stress, can lead to a fight or flight response in the body, which includes the release of stored fuels, increased breathing rate, and activation of blood clotting mechanisms. These stressors can range from injury, illness, or death, to uncertainty and lack of control, environmental factors, hunger and thirst, fatigue, and isolation. It’s important to note that what is stressful to one person may not be stressful to another.

Emotional responses to stressors can include fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, depression, loneliness, boredom, and guilt. Fear, an emotional response to dangerous situations, can encourage caution but can also immobilize a person. Anxiety, a natural response to fear, can urge action against dangers but can also overwhelm a person, making it difficult to make good judgments and decisions. Frustration arises when a person is continually thwarted in their attempts to reach a goal, which can lead to impulsive reactions, irrational behavior, poorly thought-out decisions, and an “I quit” attitude.

Depression is a common feeling in survival situations, often linked to frustration and anger. This cycle can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, causing a sense of helplessness. Loneliness and boredom can also be a source of depression. To combat depression, soldiers must find productive ways to keep their minds occupied and develop self-sufficiency. Guilt, often experienced by survivors, can be used positively to encourage survival.

Understanding personal strengths, anticipating fears, being realistic, adopting a positive attitude, reminding oneself what’s at stake, and learning stress management techniques are all crucial for survival. Soldiers must develop areas of strength and necessary survival skills through training, family, and friends. They must also be honest about situations and keep hopes and expectations within the estimate of the situation. Remember, “the will to survive” can also be considered “the refusal to give up.”
