Understanding Stress
 •Stress is a condition that all humans experience, characterized by physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual responses to life's tensions.
 •Stress provides challenges, helps understand values and strengths, and tests adaptability and flexibility.
 •It can indicate the significance we attach to an event and can be constructive or destructive.

Survival Stressors
  •Stressors are events that produce stress, while stress is the response.
  •The body prepares to fight or flee in response to a stressor, releasing stored fuels, increasing breathing rate, and activating blood clotting mechanisms.
  •The cumulative effect of minor stressors can lead to a state of exhaustion, causing signs of distress.

Types of Survival Stressors
 • Injury, Illness, or Death: These can lead to stress by limiting maneuverability, food and drink availability, and defense.
 • Uncertainty and Lack of Control: Operating in settings with limited information can be extremely stressful.
 • Environment: The stressors of weather, terrain, and the variety of creatures in an area can be a source of food and protection or cause extreme discomfort 
    leading to injury, illness, or death.
 • Hunger and Thirst: Without food and water, a person will weaken and eventually die.
 • Fatigue: The act of staying awake can be stressful in itself.
 • Isolation: Facing adversity with others provides a sense of security and a sense of help.
•Note: The stressors mentioned in this section are not the only ones, and what is stressful to one person may not be stressful to another.

Fear
• Fear is an emotional response to dangerous situations that can cause death, injury, or illness.
• It can encourage caution and caution in situations where recklessness could result in injury.
• Fear can also immobilize a person, leading to failure to perform essential survival activities.
• Soldiers must train themselves to manage their fears through realistic training.

Anxiety 
• Anxiety is a natural response to fear and can be used in a healthy way to urge action against dangers.
• In a survival setting, soldiers reduce anxiety by performing tasks that ensure survival.
• Anxiety can overwhelm a soldier, making it difficult to make good judgments and decisions.

Anger and Frustration
• Frustration arises when a person is continually thwarted in their attempts to reach a goal.
• Frustration can lead to impulsive reactions, irrational behavior, poorly thought-out decisions, and an "I quit" attitude.
• Proper channeling of anger and frustration can help soldiers productively act in survival challenges.	

Depression
• Depression is a common feeling in survival situations, often linked to frustration and anger.
• This cycle can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, causing a sense of helplessness.
• While sadness can be a temporary relief, it can sap energy and the will to survive.

Loneliness and Boredom
• Soldiers often experience isolation, which can reveal hidden talents and abilities.
• Loneliness can also be a source of depression.
• To combat depression, soldiers must find productive ways to keep their minds occupied and develop self-sufficiency.

Guilt
• Survivors may feel guilty about being spared from death, but this can be used positively to encourage survival.
• Survivors may try to carry on the work of those killed, but guilt should not prevent survival.

Understanding Personal Strengths
• Develop areas of strength and necessary survival skills through training, family, and friends.

Anticipating Fears
• Develop training in areas of fear that would frighten you the most if forced to survive alone.
• Build confidence in your ability to function despite fears.
