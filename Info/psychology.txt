Stress is a condition that all humans experience, characterized by physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual responses to life's tensions.
Stress provides challenges, helps understand values and strengths, and tests adaptability and flexibility.
It can indicate the significance we attach to an event and can be constructive or destructive.

 Stressors are events that produce stress, while stress is the response.
 The body prepares to fight or flee in response to a stressor, releasing stored fuels, increasing breathing rate, and activating blood clotting mechanisms.
 The cumulative effect of minor stressors can lead to a state of exhaustion, causing signs of distress.


 Injury, Illness, or Death: These can lead to stress by limiting maneuverability, food and drink availability, and defense.
 Uncertainty and Lack of Control: Operating in settings with limited information can be extremely stressful.
 Environment: The stressors of weather, terrain, and the variety of creatures in an area can be a source of food and protection or cause extreme discomfort leading to injury, illness, or death.
 Hunger and Thirst: Without food and water, a person will weaken and eventually die.
 Fatigue: The act of staying awake can be stressful in itself.
 Isolation: Facing adversity with others provides a sense of security and a sense of help.
Note: The stressors mentioned in this section are not the only ones, and what is stressful to one person may not be stressful to another.
